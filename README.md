# Vacuuflower

Keep the CO2 from destroying the walls of your vacuum chamber! There is a precious little plant in there which can only live without any molecules around it, so make sure that wall stays intact by collecting Calcium to repair the walls. And if you're lucky, you may find a little bit of gold on the way...

# The tools used

I used QB64 for the game mechanics and aesprite to create the graphics, including everything from sprites to the exe icon.

# The gamejam

Check out the monthly mini game jam here: http://berlinminijam.de/
This was my second time participating in any game jam, and also this particular one and worked alone, not like in <a href=https://mariocake.itch.io/laser-bees-shooting-space-frogs>my first jam participation</a>.
